jd++ programming language


I like using c++, but I think it's kind of silly to have both header and cpp files.  So I'm writing a language (jd++) where you put it all in the same file.  All the "language" will do is turn the one mashed up file into a header and a cpp file, and then compile them using g++.

This is largely in honor of John Doench, who once asked "Why do we have so many programming languages?", to which I responded because people write in a language for awhile, get annoyed with it, and then say to themselves, "I can fix this! And get street cred while doing it!"
